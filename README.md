## Mander's ~~shitty~~ dotfiles

These are my dots for my current setup. I use a lot of standard configs, this is mainly for my own sake and backup. If you wish to use, go ahead, but do know that my setup is very much mander specific. Main edits are the ones regarding the i3 keyboard shortcuts. Everything is vim styled.

### Information about my system
A quick neofetch of my current/last installation: 

```bash
                   -`                    mander@CL4P-TP 
                  .o+`                   --------------

```

### To-do:
- [] Customize rofi, make it more gruvbox
- [] Customize polybar, make my own version of it
- [] Work on my termite fork to set up the keyboard shortcuts better
- [] Get startup-scripts
- [] Fix zsh config
- [] ~~Create installation script~~

### Section where I can spend time praising other lovely human beings
Because in this community we all need to show some love to people/tools that are amazing. Give them a hug and thank them for contributing with great things!

### Tools I use
- [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3), a fork of [i3](https://i3wm.org/) that adds gaps to the config
- [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi), a manager that i use along with [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/)
- [termite](https://github.com/thestinger/termite), a terminal with keybind support, yay! less mouse usage!
- [tbsm](https://github.com/loh-tar/tbsm), a login manager that allows you to log in straight from the terminal! 
- [autorandr](https://github.com/phillipberndt/autorandr), life savior if you are using multiple monitors for i3
- [dunst](https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst), notification dameon, my config is broken, but the tool is lovely
- [nvim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim), what happens if you imorove vi twice? this. this is what happens. It's gret!
- [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/), my shell that I use, currently the config is too much of a mess for me to upload it here though
